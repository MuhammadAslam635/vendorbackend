            question: "What is core aeration?",
            answer: "Core aeration is a lawn care process that removes small plugs of soil from the ground. This relieves compaction, improves airflow, and allows water and nutrients to reach grass roots more effectively."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I know if my lawn needs core aeration?",
            answer: "If your lawn feels hard, drains poorly, develops bare patches, or has heavy foot traffic or thick thatch, it's likely time to core aerate. Lawns with clay soil are especially prone to compaction. Each growing season is recommended."
        },
        {
            question: "When is the best time to core aerate my lawn?",
            answer: "‚Ä¢ Cool-season grasses (like Kentucky bluegrass or fescue): Early spring or fall\n‚Ä¢ Warm-season grasses (like Bermuda or zoysia): Late spring to early summer\n‚Ä¢ Avoid core aerating during peak stress periods like mid-summer heat for cool-season grasses."
        },
        {
            question: "How often should I aerate my lawn?",
            answer: "‚Ä¢ Clay soil or high foot traffic: Twice per year each growing season\n‚Ä¢ Loamy or moderate use: Twice per year each growing season\n‚Ä¢ Low-traffic lawns: Every 1-2 times per year\n‚Ä¢ Sandy lawns: Microbial aeration is recommended 2 times per year"
        },
        {
            question: "What happens to the soil plugs after core aeration?",
            answer: "The small plugs of soil and thatch will naturally break down over time. As they decompose, they return valuable nutrients back to the lawn."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I mow or fertilize after core aeration?",
            answer: "Yes! In fact, core aerating before fertilizing helps nutrients reach the root zone more effectively. Wait a day or two before mowing to allow the soil to settle."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the benefits of a healthy lawn?",
            answer: "‚Ä¢ Healthy grass produces enough oxygen to sustain a family of four for an entire year\n‚Ä¢ Lawns improve soil filtration, helping to purify rainwater\n‚Ä¢ The combined front lawns of eight average homes can have the same cooling effect as 70 tons of air conditioning\n‚Ä¢ Grass captures an estimated 12 million tons of dust and dirt annually\n‚Ä¢ Lawns act as a carbon sink‚ÄîU.S. lawns could store up to 37 billion pounds of carbon annually"
        },
        {
            question: "What should I avoid when core aerating?",
            answer: "Key things to avoid:\n‚Ä¢ Poor timing: Don't aerate when soil is too dry/wet or during drought\n‚Ä¢ Improper equipment: Always use a core aerator, not a spike aerator\n‚Ä¢ Neglecting preparation: Mark obstacles and utilities before starting\n‚Ä¢ Poor aftercare: Avoid heavy traffic and let soil plugs decompose naturally"

                                <div className="card-content">
                                    <strong>Relieves Soil Compaction:</strong> Compacted soil prevents water, oxygen, and nutrients from reaching the roots. Core aeration opens up the soil, giving your grass room to breathe and grow.<br /><br />

                                    <strong>Improves Water and Nutrient Absorption:</strong> The holes provide entry points for nutrients, air, and water while creating an ideal bed for overseeding. This allows deeper penetration and improves efficiency.<br /><br />

                                    <strong>Reduces Thatch Build-Up:</strong> Breaks down the layer of dead organic matter that blocks essential resources and encourages beneficial microbial activity.

                                    <strong>Equipment Used:</strong> A core aerator uses hollow tines to remove 2‚Äì4 inch plugs of soil from the lawn.<br /><br />

                                    <strong>After Aeration:</strong> The soil plugs are left on the lawn to naturally break down and return nutrients to the soil.<br /><br />

                                    <strong>Additional Benefits:</strong> Prevents water pooling, reduces runoff, and boosts drought resistance through deeper root development.

                        <ul className="process-list">
                            <li><strong>Relieves Soil Compaction:</strong> Compacted soil prevents water, oxygen, and nutrients from reaching the roots. Core aeration opens up the soil, giving your grass room to breathe and grow.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improves Water and Nutrient Absorption:</strong> The holes left by core aeration provide a seed bed and an entry point for nutrients, air, and water, as well as providing a bed for overseeding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduces Thatch Build-Up:</strong> Thatch is a layer of dead organic matter that blocks essential resources. Core aeration helps break it down and encourages microbial activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prevents Water Pooling and Runoff:</strong> Aerated lawns absorb water more effectively, reducing puddling and erosion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Boosts Drought Resistance:</strong> Deeper and thicker roots make your lawn more resilient during dry, hot conditions.</li>

                            <li><strong>Equipment Used:</strong> A core aerator uses hollow tines to remove 2‚Äì4 inch plugs of soil from the lawn.</li>
                            <li><strong>After Core Aeration:</strong> The soil plugs are left on the lawn to naturally break down and return nutrients to the soil.</li>

                        Absolutely. Without it, compacted soil and thatch buildup can choke your lawn, leaving it thin, stressed, and discolored‚Äîespecially late in the season. Core aeration restores healthy airflow, encourages strong and thicker root development, and sets the foundation for a thick, lush lawn.

                    <ul className="process-list">
                        <li><strong>Too dry or too wet?</strong> Soil that's bone-dry won't allow deep core aeration, and soggy soil can clog the machine or tear the turf.</li>
                        <li><strong>During drought or extreme heat?</strong> Avoid aerating when your lawn is already under stress‚Äîit could worsen the damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wrong season?</strong>
                            <ul className="nested-list">
                                <li>Cool-season grasses: Core aerate in early fall or spring</li>
                                <li>Warm-season grasses: Core aerate in late spring or early summer</li>

                        <li><strong>Using a spike aerator:</strong> These can compact soil rather than loosen it. Always use a core aerator that removes actual plugs of soil.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skipping pre-watering:</strong> Light watering the day before helps the tines penetrate better‚Äîbut don't soak the lawn.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forgetting to mark obstacles:</strong> Flag sprinkler heads, valve boxes, and anything underground to avoid damage.

                                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> We recommend calling in a public utility locator company before starting any job. Private utilities are different than public utilities.</li>
